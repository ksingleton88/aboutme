   <p class="question"> A Little About Myself </p>
   <p class="answer">I'm a nerd at heart and love to play video games! Coding is a challenge that I love to beat. I view it as a game and upon completion of a site, I feel like I have conquered! As much as I love staring at a computer all day (or tv), I must be outside. Hiking is one of my absolute favorite hobbies and tennis if I have a good partner to play with! You will also find me gardening on weekends and volunteering at our local parks as well as teaching others IT Literacy.</p>
